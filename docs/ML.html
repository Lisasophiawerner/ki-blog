      <p> With machine learning, you feed data into an aglorithm to state the accuracy of a result. But how does it work?
       every basic machine learning program performs these two major tasks:</p>
      <p><list>Classification : Classification is a supervised machine learning process that involves predicting the class of given data points. Those 
           classes can be targets, labels or categories. For example, a spam detection machine learning algorithm would aim to classify emails as either
           “spam” or “not spam.” </list></p>
           <p><list>Prediction : Machine learning prediction refers to the output of an algorithm that has been trained on a historical dataset. 
               The algorithm then generates probable values for unknown variables in each record of the new data. The purpose of prediction in machine learning
               is to project a probable data set that relates back to the original data. It is used to make future predictions like if the stock will go up, or which 
               video should be suggested next, based on your prevoious watch.</list></p>
               
               <p>Machine learning algorithms can be further divided into two categories: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised algorithms require a training dataset that 
               includes both the input data and the desired output. Unsupervised algorithms do not require a training dataset, and instead rely on data to "learn" on its own.</p>
               
              <p>Machine learning itself has several subsets of AI within it, including neural networks, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. 
               These subsets also also perform the 2 major tasks, but also do something special.
               <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate 
               the behavior of the human brain, allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single 
               layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy.</p></p>
               
              <p> Deep learning drives many AI applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. 
               Deep learning technology lies behind everyday products and services (such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection) 
               as well as emerging technologies (such as self-driving cars).</p>
               
               
              <p> There is also the reinforcement learning subset of machine learning.
               Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that is used to create a model of how to behave in a particular situation. This type of learning is used 
               to create models of how to behave in order to achieve a particular goal. It is used to create models of how to behave in order to achieve a goal, such as learning 
               how to play a game or how to navigate a maze. </p> 
               
           <p>  in a nutshell, Machine Learning is basically training a computer to perform a task, without programming to specifically perform that task.</p>
