    <p>First of all, what even is Chat GPT?</p>
   <p> ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by 
    OpenAI and released in November 2022. The name "ChatGPT" combines "Chat", 
    referring to its chatbot functionality, and "GPT", which stands for Generative 
    Pre-trained Transformer, a type of large language model (LLM). ChatGPT is built 
    upon OpenAI's foundational GPT models, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and has been fine-tuned 
    (an approach to transfer learning) for conversational applications using a combination of supervised 
    and reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

    <p>ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, and gained attention for its detailed and articulate responses 
    spanning various domains of knowledge. However, a notable drawback has been its tendency to confidently 
    provide inaccurate information.</p>
    
   <p> Now you have an idea of what Chat GPT is. But how does it work?</p>

   <p> Once you give ChatGPT a question or prompt, it passes through the AI model and the chatbot produces 
    a response based on the information you've given and how that fits into its vast amount of training data. 
    It's during this training that ChatGPT has learned what word, or sequence of words, typically follows the l
    ast one in a given context.</p>
