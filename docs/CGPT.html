    <p>First of all, what even is Chat GPT?</p>
   <p> ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by 
    OpenAI. The name "ChatGPT" combines "Chat", 
    referring to its chatbot functionality, and "GPT", which stands for Generative 
    Pre-trained Transformer, a type of large language model (LLM). ChatGPT is built 
    upon OpenAI's foundational GPT models, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and has been fine-tuned 
    (an approach to transfer learning) for conversational applications using a combination of supervised 
    and reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

    <p>ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, and gained attention for its detailed and articulate responses 
    spanning various domains of knowledge. However, a notable drawback has been its tendency to confidently 
    provide inaccurate information.</p>
    
   <p> Now you have an idea of what Chat GPT is. But how does it work?</p>

   <p>
    Once you give ChatGPT a question or prompt, it passes through the AI model and the chatbot produces a response 
    based on the information you've given and how that fits into its vast amount of training data. It's during this 
    training that ChatGPT has learned what word, or sequence of words, typically follows the last one in a given context.
    OpenAI feeds ChatGPT with a vast amount of text data. ChatGPT then uses that data to try to predict what the next word 
    should be based on the examples it was given. OpenAI evaluates those predictions and makes adjustments. That process is 
    repeated over and over again many times.

    Eventually, ChatGPT reached a point where its predictions were good enough to generate human-like responses. </p>
    <p> But what are the limits of Chat GPT</p>
    <p>Chat GPT has a very wide understanding in a lot of topics. However it comes across limitations when confronted
        with input that is largely abbreviated or written in slang, since it still is an AI program and not an actual person,
    who could understand these things with human communication. But it also struggles if the input is overly complex or too difficult
to understand, it struggles to provide an accurate answer. Another part where it still stuggles is when answering a question in a long 
answer. It is acccurate with short explanations and answers but when the answer gets too long, the accuracy decreases. 
 It may not be able to answer questions about very specific or niche topics, and it may not be aware of recent developments 
    or changes in certain fields.</p>
    <p> These are just some of the flieds where Chat GPT is still limited. Of course it is also limited with empathy and sarcasm,
        because these are things from human communication. Even though Chat GPT can do alot, it's still not a human being and therefore 
        will never have feelings like a human.
