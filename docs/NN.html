</p> What is a neural network?</p>
<p>A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It consists of 
interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons or "neurons," which are organized into layers.The neurons in a neural network
receive inputs, perform calculations on those inputs, and produce an output. The connections between neurons have associated weights 
that determine the strength and importance of the signals being transmitted. Through a process called training, neural networks can learn 
from data to adjust these weights and improve their performance on specific tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, 
or prediction.Neural networks have found wide applications in various fields, including computer vision, speech recognition, pattern and machine
translation, among others. They have been instrumental in the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning.<p>
