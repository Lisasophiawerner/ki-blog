</p> What is a neural network?</p>
<p>A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It consists of 
interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons or "neurons," which each are a learning unit. Let's set an example for a better
understanding. Let's say that the purpose of this neural network, that is seen on the image, is to determine wether an image is 
a black cat, a brown owl or a white horse. These are the inputs. The hidden layers all have a certain question or condition which
they answer with yes or no ( yes = 1 and no = 0). They answer their specific condition by checking if that condition is fulfilled. For example
if the image has feaathers, one of the nodes in the hidden layer determines wether it's condition is fulfiled and passes it's answer (yes or no)
to the next layer, which is the output layer.The output nodes recieve answers from muliple hidden nodes, and integrate all the results and then 
determines the probability wether it's their image or not. SO every Input node and output node is assigned to an image. The connections between 
neurons have associated weights that determine the strength and importance of the signals being transmitted. Through a process called training,each 
node of the neural network can learn from data to adjust it's weight and improve their performance on specific tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, 
or prediction.Neural networks have found wide applications in various fields, including computer vision, speech recognition, pattern and machine
translation, among others. They have been instrumental in the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning.<p>
    <p>A neural network consists of three different types of layers:

       <li>Input layer: responsible for receiving input data and passing it on to the next layer. This is the first layer in a neural network</li>
        <li>Hidden layers: can be found in almost every type of neural network.</li>
       <li> Output layer: the last layer in a neural network which produces the final output or prediction </li></p>
      </p>
<p>The more layers are available, the more predictions the algorithm can make and therefore the responses in i.e Chat GPT will be more diverse.</p>
