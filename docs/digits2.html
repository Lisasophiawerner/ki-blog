        <p>This digit recognition is the perfect example of how a neural network functions,
            and also what can be improved. 
        </p>
        <p> Below you can see 2 screenshots of 2 completely different outomes. In the image with the number 8,
            the number which it guessed is correct with a good amount of probability that it's right. 
            However in the image with the number 4, which it guessed as a 1, the number which it guessed was incorrect
            but it was very sure that it had the right answer.</p>
            <p>So what does this tell us?</p>
            <p> In the example with the 8, the weight each hidden node performed correctly. Therefore the final result plus the 
                probability are correct. The number 8 is pretty unique, in comparison to the other digits, which makes it way less
                likely for an error to occur.
            </p>
            <p> However in the example with the 4, we can see that hidden nodes which were responsible for the straight line, had more weight 
                than other hidden nodes (the ones from the other line). This is a typlical example of when a neural network relies to much 
                on a group of hidden nodes that performed well during training. It is more likely that an error occurs with the numbers 1,4 and 7
                since they are all written pretty similarly.
